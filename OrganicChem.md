# Organic Chemistry 

All organic compounds contain carbon, they usually contain hydrogen and may contain other elements as well. 

Millions of organic compounds are known. So we have to make groups and we have to make rules for naming them.

##  Homologous Series

- Homologous series: A group of organic molecules, with similar chemical properties is called homologous series. 

- Examples 
  - Alkenes: Alkenes Are hydrocarbons which have only single covalent bond in their structure
  - Alcohols: All alcohols have an -OH group and --OH
  - Carboxylic acids: Carboxylic acid has an -COOH group

## Characteristics of a homologous series: 

  - All members have the same general formula.
  - They have very similar chemical properties because they are of a same functional group.
  - The physical properties change in a predictable way as the number of carbon atoms increases.
  - Consecutive members in a homologous series differ by a ch2 group. 
  - The chain length increases by 1 each time
  - As the chain gets longer, the compounds show a gradual change in properties

## Name of Compounds

Name ending → compound-type name

- “ane” → alkane
- “ene” → alkene
- “ol” → alcohol
- “oic acid” → carboxylic acid
- “yl”, “oate” → ester
