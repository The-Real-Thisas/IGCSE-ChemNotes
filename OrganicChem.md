# Organic Chemistry 

All organic compounds contain carbon, they usually contain hydrogen and may contain other elements as well. 

Millions of organic compounds are known. So we have to make groups and we have to make rules for naming them.

##  Homologous Series

- Homologous series: A group of organic molecules, with similar chemical properties is called homologous series. 

- Examples 
  - Alkenes: Alkenes Are hydrocarbons which have only single covalent bond in their structure
  - Alkanes: Alkanes are organic compounds that consist entirely of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms and lack any other functional groups. The distinguishing feature of an alkane, making it distinct from other compounds that also exclusively contain carbon and hydrogen, is its lack of unsaturation.
  - Alcohols: All alcohols have an -OH group and --OH
  - Carboxylic acids: Carboxylic acid has an -COOH group

- Empirical formulae: It is the simplest ratio of molecules in an atom.

## Characteristics of a homologous series: 

  - All members have the same general formula.
  - They have very similar chemical properties because they are of a same functional group.
  - The physical properties change in a predictable way as the number of carbon atoms increases.
  - Consecutive members in a homologous series differ by a ch2 group. 
  - The chain length increases by 1 each time
  - As the chain gets longer, the compounds show a gradual change in properties

## Name of Compounds

Name ending → compound-type name

- “ane” → alkane
- “ene” → alkene
- “ol” → alcohol
- “oic acid” → carboxylic acid
- “yl”, “oate” → ester

### Saturated compounds 

> If the compound has a double bond or triple bonds they are known as an unsaturated compound. They do not have the maximum number of hydrogen atoms around the carbon atom.

### Fuctional Groups

> A group of atoms that is responsible for the characteristic reactions of a homologous series. 

## Alkanes

What are Alkanes  ?
 > Alkanes are organic compounds that consist entirely of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms and lack any other functional groups. The distinguishing feature of an alkane, making it distinct from other compounds that also exclusively contain carbon and hydrogen, is its lack of unsaturation.
 > CNH2N+2

## Properties of Alkanes (And alkenes)

All alkanes are composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms, and have similar bonds, structures, and formulas. The number of carbon atoms present in an alkane has no limit. Greater numbers of atoms in the molecules will lead to stronger intermolecular attractions and correspondingly different physical properties of the molecules. Properties such as melting point and boiling point (Table below) usually change smoothly and predictably as the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecules change.
