# Organic Chemistry 

All organic compounds contain carbon, they usually contain hydrogen and may contain other elements as well. 

Millions of organic compounds are known. So we have to make groups and we have to make rules for naming them.

##  Homologous Series

- Homologous series: ‘family’ of similar compounds with similar properties due to the presence of the same functional group.

- Characteristics of a homologous series: 

-- all the compounds fit the same general formula
-- the chain length increases by 1 each time
-- as the chain gets longer, the compounds show a gradual change in properties

- Structural isomers: have the same chemical formula, but 
different structures, they can be straight or branched
