# Organic Chemistry

All organic compounds contain carbon, they usually contain hydrogen and may contain other elements as well.

Millions of organic compounds are known. So we have to make groups and we have to make rules for naming them.

##  Homologous Series

- Homologous series: A group of organic molecules, with similar chemical properties is called homologous series.

- Examples
  - Alkenes: Alkenes Are hydrocarbons which have only single covalent bond in their structure
  - Alkanes: Alkanes are organic compounds that consist entirely of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms and lack any other functional groups. The distinguishing feature of an alkane, making it distinct from other compounds that also exclusively contain carbon and hydrogen, is its lack of unsaturation.
  - Alcohols: All alcohols have an -OH group and --OH
  - Carboxylic acids: Carboxylic acid has an -COOH group

- Empirical formulae: It is the simplest ratio of molecules in an atom.

## Characteristics of a homologous series:

  - All members have the same general formula.
  - They have very similar chemical properties because they are of a same functional group.
  - The physical properties change in a predictable way as the number of carbon atoms increases.
  - Consecutive members in a homologous series differ by a ch2 group.
  - The chain length increases by 1 each time
  - As the chain gets longer, the compounds show a gradual change in properties

## Name of Compounds

Name ending → compound-type name

- “ane” → alkane
- “ene” → alkene
- “ol” → alcohol
- “oic acid” → carboxylic acid
- “yl”, “oate” → ester

### Saturated compounds

> If the compound has a double bond or triple bonds they are known as an unsaturated compound. They do not have the maximum number of hydrogen atoms around the carbon atom.

### Fuctional Groups

> A group of atoms that is responsible for the characteristic reactions of a homologous series.

## Alkanes

What are Alkanes  ?
 > Alkanes are organic compounds that consist entirely of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms and lack any other functional groups. The distinguishing feature of an alkane, making it distinct from other compounds that also exclusively contain carbon and hydrogen, is its lack of unsaturation.
 > CNH2N+2
 > Alkanes are the only have a single covalent bond in their structor. We call then Saturated hydrocarbons, because no more atoms can be added to their molecules.

## Properties of Alkanes (And alkenes)

All alkanes are composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms, and have similar bonds, structures, and formulas. The number of carbon atoms present in an alkane has no limit. Greater numbers of atoms in the molecules will lead to stronger intermolecular attractions and correspondingly different physical properties of the molecules. Properties such as melting point and boiling point (Table below) usually change smoothly and predictably as the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecules change.

## Thursday 9th July (Notes)

#### Alkanes are the only hydrocarbon to have a single covalent bond in their structor. We call then Saturated hydrocarbons, because no more atoms can be added to their molecules.


#### Alkanes are generally unreactive but by in certain conditions we can subject alkanes to 2 different types of combustion. Complete and incomplete combustion. With complete combustion it produces carbon dioxide and water . Likewise, with incomplete combustion, It produces carbon monoxide and sut.

#### A photochemical reaction ina chlorine atom replaces a hydrogen atom in the alkane.We call this type of reaction a substitution reaction..

C3H8 + 5 O2 = 3 CO2 + 4 H2O
2 C3H8 + 7 O2 = 6 CO + 8 H2O
C3H8 + 2 O2 = 3 C + 4 H2O

## Fuels 

Fuels to know:
    - Coal
    - Natural gas: main constituent is methane
    - Petroleum: a mixture of hydrocarbons which can be separated into fractions

Uses of Petroleum Fractions
 - Refinery gas: bottled gas for heating and cooking
 - Gasoline fraction: fuel (petrol) in cars
 - Naphtha fraction: making chemicals
 - Kerosene/paraffin fraction: jet fuel, lamps
 - Diesel oil/gas oil fraction: fuel in diesel engines
 - Fuel oil fraction: fuel in ships and home heating systems
 - Lubricating fraction: lubricants, waxes and polishes
 - Bitumen: making roads

## Petroleum

There are three types of fossil feuls:
 - Coal
 - petroleum(crude oil)
 - natural gas

### Formation of petroleum
The formation of petroteum (or crude oil) is one of the Earth's major natural resources, the result of a process that began up to 400 million years ago. When prehistoric marine creatures died, they sank to the seabed and were Covered by mud. The change into petroleum and natural gas was brought about by high pressure, high temperature and bacteria acting over millions of years. The original organic material broke down into hydrocarbons. Compression of the mud above the hydrocarbon mixture transformed it into shale. Then geological movements and pressure changed this shale into harder rocks, squeezing out the oil and gas. The oil and gas moved upwards through the porous rocks, moving from high-pressure to low-pressure conditions. Sometimes they reached the surface, but often they became trapped by a layer of non-porous rock.

Reservoirs of oil arid has were created. These reservoirs are not lakes of oil or pockets of gas, instead, the oil or gas is spread throughout the pores in coarse rocks such as sandstone or limestone, in much the same way as water is held in a sponge. 

Oilfields and gasfields are detected by a series of geological and seismic surveys. Promising areas are then drilled to gain more geological information or, if oil or gas is found, to see how extensive the old oilfield or gasfield is. Once a field is established production oil rigs can be set up, on land or at sea. 


### Fractional distillation

Fractional distillation Petroleum is the mixture of many different hydrocarbon molecules. Most of the petroleum that is extracted from the ground is used to make fuel, but around 10% is used as a feedstock, or raw materials, in the chemical industry. Before it can be used, the various hydrocarbon molecules are separated by refining. This is done by fractional distillation at an oil refinery. 

At a refinery, petroleum is separated into different fractions - groups of hydrocarbons that have different boiling points. These different boiling points are roughly related to the number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbons.

Separation of the hydrocarbons takes place by fractional distillation using a fractionating column (or tower). At the start of the refining process, petroleum is preheated to a temperature of 350-400 °C and pumped in at the base of the tower. As it boils, the vapour passes up the tower. It passes through a series of bubble caps, and cools as it rises further up the column. The different fractions cool and condense at different temperatures, and therefore at different heights in the column. The fractions condensing at the different levels are collected on trays. Fractions from the top of the tower are called 'light' and those from the bottom 'heavy'. Each fraction contains a number of diffrent hydrocarbons. The individual single hydrocarbons can then be obtained by further distillation.

 Fraction | Approximate number of carbon atoms in hydrocarbons | Appeoximate boiling range / C
 refinery gas | 1 - 4 | C1-C4 | below 25
