# Atoms, elements and compounds

## Atomic structure and the Periodic Table

> Proton number: number of protons in an atom (and number of electrons in an atom)

> Nucleon number: number of protons + neutrons in an atom.

- In the periodic table
  - The proton number increases by 1 when you go to the right
  - When you go one element down, you increase proton number by 8 in the first 3 periods (transition elements not included)

- Isotopes: atoms of same element with different no. of neutrons 
  - E.g. Carbon 12 and Carbon 14.
  - Two types: non-radioactive isotopes and radioactive isotopes which are unstable atoms that break down giving radiations.
  - Medical use: cancer treatment (radiotherapy) – rays kill cancer cells using cobalt-60
  - Industrial use: to check for leaks – radioisotopes (tracers) added to oil/gas. At leaks radiation is detected using a Geiger counter.

- Electrons are arranged in electron shells. 
- Atoms want to have full outer shells (full set of valency electrons), this is why they react.
- Noble gases have full outer shells so they have no need to react. 
- Electron shell structure: 2, 8, 8, 18. 
- More reactive elements have a greater desire to have a full outer shell, so also form more stable compounds.

## Bonding: the Structure of Matter

> Element: substance that cannot be split into anything simpler, in a chemical reaction. Each element has a unique proton number.

> Mixture: two or more elements mixed together but not chemically combined.

> Compound: substance in which two or more different elements are chemically combined.

- Metals:
  - Strong
  - Good conductors of heat and electricity
  - High melting point and boiling point
  - Forms basic oxides
  - Forms cations in reactions
  - Malleable and ductile
  - Sonorous
  - Some are magnetic

- Non-Metals:
  - Brittle
  - Poor conductor of heat and electricity (Aside from Graphite)
  - Low melting and boiling point
  - Low density
  - Forms acidic oxides
  - Forms anions in reactions

> Alloy: Mixture of two or more metals or mixture of one or more metal with a non-metal, to improve its properties

## Ions and Ionic Bonds

- Chemical bond formed by transfer of 𝑒̅s from one atom to another.

- Metals lose 𝑒̅s to form cations, non-metals gain 𝑒̅s to form anions.

- Positive cations & negative anions attract to each other.

- Strong electrostatic force of attraction between positive cations and negative anions is called ionic bonding.
