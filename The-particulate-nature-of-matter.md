- When a solid is heated, particles vibrate faster about a fixed point causing particles to move further apart and so solid expands

- When particles gain sufficient energy to overcome strong forces of attraction, they move out of their fixed position and can slide over each other in a continuous random motion – solid has melted.

- Particles in liquid have energy to move around but are still close to each other and do not have enough energy to overcome the forces that hold them close to each other.

- If more heat’s supplied, particles move faster until they have enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction. Particles escape the liquids surface and move around in continuous rapid motion – the liquid has boiled.

- In the vapor, the particles move in rapid random motion. This movement is due to collision of vapor particles with air particles.

## States of Matter

Solid | Liquid | Gas
------|--------|-----
Strong forces of attraction between particles. | Weaker attractive forces than solids. | Almost no intermolecular forces.
Fixed pattern. (lattice) | No fixed pattern, liquids take up the shape of their container. | Particles far apart, and move quickly.
Atoms vibrate but can’t change position ∴ have a fixed volume and shape. | Particles slide past each other. | Collide with each other and bounce in all directions.

## Diffusion

> Diffusion is the spreading of one substance through another from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration due to the continuous random motion of particles.

- Evidence for diffusion:
  - In liquids: potassium manganate (VII) in a beaker of water.
  - In gases: a gas jar of air and a gas jar of bromine connected.

- Factors that affect the rate of diffusion:
  - Temperature increases → rate of diffusion increases
  - Lower density gas → rate of diffusion is higher
